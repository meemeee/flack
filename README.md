## Description

This project is an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to [Slack](https://slack.com/features). The project uses Javascript to run code client-side, AJAX to request data from server asynchronously, and Socket.IO to communicate between clients and servers.

Made for project 2 of [CS50Web](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/).

### Features
- **Display name**: On the first visit, user will log in with a display name, which will be associated with every message the user sends.
- **Create channels**: Any user can create a new channel, so long as its name doesnâ€™t conflict with the name of an existing channel.
- **Channel List**: Switching among channels will not require reloading the page.
- **Messages View**: The user can see up to 100 latest messages in a single channel. 
- **Send and receive messages in real time**: Sending and receiving messages will not require reloading the page.
- **Remove messages**: Hovering on one message to see an option to remove it (limited to its sender). This is also a real-time action. 
- **New message alert**: If there are unread messages while user is logged in, the corresponding channel will be displayed differently to indicate new messages.  
- **Remember the Channel**: If the user closes a channel page (by closing the browser window), he will be taken back to that channel on his next visit.
